# HaScheme

This is an Scheme implementation written in Haskell using the "Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours" resource: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours.

## Usage

Run with `cabal run hascheme` for REPL, or `cabal run hascheme "<INPUT>"` to eval a single line of code to run from Cabal.

Run the executable at root `hascheme` to enter REPL; use `(load "stdlib.scm")` to load standard lib in.

To exit REPL type `quit`.
